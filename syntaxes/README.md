# Syntax highlighting

A TextMate grammar and a language configuration for DTL, shipped with the
language so an editor does not have to guess.

| File | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `dtl.tmLanguage.json` | TextMate grammar, scope `source.dtl` |
| `language-configuration.json` | Comments, brackets, auto-closing and surrounding pairs |

TextMate is the format VS Code, Sublime Text, GitHub Linguist and most other
editors read, so one grammar covers nearly everything. It highlights by pattern
matching, without parsing — fast, and correct on a half-typed file, which is
the state a file being edited is usually in.

## VS Code

Reference them from an extension's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "contributes": {
    "languages": [{
      "id": "dtl",
      "extensions": [".dtl"],
      "configuration": "./syntaxes/language-configuration.json"
    }],
    "grammars": [{
      "language": "dtl",
      "scopeName": "source.dtl",
      "path": "./syntaxes/dtl.tmLanguage.json"
    }]
  }
}
```

Pair it with [`cmd/dtl-lsp`](../cmd/dtl-lsp) and you have highlighting,
completion, hover and diagnostics with no bespoke client code.

## Shiki

[Shiki](https://shiki.style) renders TextMate grammars, so this file works as a
custom language with no conversion:

```js
import { createHighlighter } from 'shiki'
import grammar from 'dtl/syntaxes/dtl.tmLanguage.json' with { type: 'json' }

const highlighter = await createHighlighter({
  themes: ['github-dark'],
  langs: [grammar],
})

const html = highlighter.codeToHtml('fn double(x: float) -> float => x * 2', {
  lang: 'dtl',
  theme: 'github-dark',
})
```

The grammar carries `name`, `displayName` (`Data Transformation Language`) and `fileTypes`, which is
what Shiki reads when registering it. It carries no `aliases`: an alias equal to
the language name is a self-reference, and Shiki rejects that outright with
`Circular alias \`dtl -> dtl\``.

This is how docs sites highlight these languages — Astro Starlight, VitePress,
Nuxt Content and Docusaurus all render through Shiki, so passing the grammar
once is the whole integration.

## Other editors

- **Sublime Text** — reads `.tmLanguage.json` directly; drop it in a package.
- **Neovim / Helix / Zed** — prefer tree-sitter. This grammar will not load
  there; see below.
- **GitHub** — syntax colouring for a new language goes through
  [Linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist), which accepts a
  TextMate grammar. This one is the file to submit.
- **Anything embedding Monaco** — the same grammar works via
  `monaco-textmate`.

## Highlighting from the language itself

Pattern matching does not know what a name refers to — a local, a builtin and
a user-defined function all look alike to a regular expression.

The accurate alternative is LSP **semantic tokens**, where the server
classifies each token using the parser and the registry it already has. That is
not implemented yet; it belongs in `cmd/dtl-lsp`, which already holds the
document text and everything needed to answer. Until then this grammar is what
provides colour, and it is sufficient for reading code.
